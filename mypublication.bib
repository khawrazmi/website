The dynamics of these observers are nonlinear, but the agents only need to have access to local information to implement them. We show that under a general condition on the structure of the underlying time-varying directed graphs, the difference of the agents' estimates and the true average is upper bounded. Using this result, we show that when we have a class P∗ weakly exponentially ergodic flow and the agent's objective functions are differentiable with bounded gradients, any trajectory of the proposed continuous-time dynamics is globally asymptotically convergent to a minimizer. Finally, we demonstrate that the class P∗ weakly exponentially ergodic flow property can be achieved by assuming that the sequence of Laplacians are measurable, cut-balanced, and has a minimum instantaneous flow. As a by-product, we show that the proposed continuous-time dynamics for distributed convex optimization is convergent on any sequence of time-varying strongly connected directed graph.},

A constant-rate multi-mode system is a hybrid system that can switch freely among a finite set of modes, and whose dynamics is specified by a finite number of real-valued variables with mode-dependent constant rates. We introduce and study a stochastic extension of a constant-rate multi-mode system where the dynamics is specified by mode-dependent compactly supported probability distributions over a set of constant rate vectors. The almost-sure reachability problem for stochastic multi-mode systems is to decide whether for all ϵ > 0 and for all pairs of start and target states in a path-connected and bounded safety set there exists a control strategy that almost-surely steers the system from the start state to the ϵ-neighborhood of the target state without leaving the safety set. We prove a necessary and sufficient condition to decide almost-sure reachability and, using this condition, we show that almost-sure reachability can be decided in polynomial time. Our algorithm can be used as a path-following algorithm in combination with off-the-shelf path-planning algorithms to make a robot with noisy low-level controllers follow a path with arbitrary precision.},

Our framework considers querying as a collaboration between the user and the database system to establish a mutual language for representing information needs. We formalize this collaboration as a signaling game, where each mutual language is an equilibrium for the game. A query interface is more effective if it establishes a less ambiguous mutual language faster. We discuss some equilibria, strategies, and the convergence rates in this game.

This is done by incorporating a physical connectivity graph that accounts for the external factors that may prevent interaction between certain pairs of agents. As opposed to the original Hegselmann-Krause dynamics (which terminate in finite time), we show that for any underlying graph that is connected but not complete, there exists an initial condition under which the dynamics never terminate. As a result, we show that for any continuous probability density function having the state space as its support, the expected termination time of the modified dynamics is infinity.

Under some additional technical assumptions on the gradients we prove the convergence of the distributed push-sum algorithm to some critical point of the objective function. By utilizing perturbations on the update process, we show the almost sure convergence of the perturbed dynamics to a local minimum of the global objective function, if the objective function has no saddle points.

We argue that this connectivity assumption is weaker and hence more realistic than the popular assumption of uniform strong connectivity.

We also introduce the novel notions of social equivalence and social dominance, and show some of their interesting implications, including their correspondence to consensus. Finally, using a classical result of Hirsch [1], we fully characterize the stability of these dynamical systems for the case of star graphs with asymmetric interactions. Various examples illustrate our results. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

This paper studies the performance of a model predictive control (MPC) algorithm in a home energy management system (HEMS) as the set of controllable resources varies and under both a constant and a time-of-use (TOU) electricity price structure. The set of controllable resources includes residentially-owned photovoltaic (PV) panels, a home battery system (HBS), an electric vehicle (EV), and a home heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. The HEMS optimally schedules the set of controllable resources given user preferences such as indoor thermal comfort and electricity cost sensitivity. The home energy management system is built on a chance constrained, MPC-based algorithm, where the chance constraint ensures the indoor thermal comfort is satisfied with a high probability given uncertainty in the outdoor temperature and solar irradiance forecasts. Simulation results for varying sets of controllable resources under two different electricity price structures demonstrate the variation in the HEMS control with respect to HBS operation, electricity cost, and grid power usage.},

Continuous response threshold functions to coordinate collaborative tasks in multi-agent systems are commonly employed models in a number of fields including ethology, economics, and swarm robotics. Although empirical evidence exists for the response threshold model in predicting and matching swarm behavior for social insects, there has been no formal argument as to why natural swarms use this approach and why it should be used for engineering artificial ones. In this paper, we show, by formulating task allocation as a global game, that continuous response threshold functions used for communication-free task assignment result in system level Bayesian Nash equilibria. Building up on these results, we show that individual agents not only do not need to communicate with each other, but also do not need to model each other's behavior, which makes this coordination mechanism accessible to very simple agents, suggesting a reason for their prevalence in nature and motivating their use in an engineering context.},

There are a finite number of players who repeatedly update from a finite number of available languages/signaling strategies.

We analyze the long-run distribution of states and show that, for sufficiently small mutation probability, its support is limited to efficient communication systems. We find that this behavior is insensitive to the particular choice of evolutionary dynamic, a property that is due to the game having a potential structure with a potential function corresponding to average fitness. Consequently, the model supports conclusions similar to those found in the literature on language competition. That is, we show that efficient languages eventually predominate the society while reproducing the empirical phenomenon of linguistic drift. The emergence of efficiency in the atomic case can be contrasted with results for non-atomic signaling games that establish the non-negligible possibility of convergence, under replicator dynamics, to states of unbounded efficiency loss.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. We propose a novel graph-based reformulation for the concept of evolutionarily stable strategies. Evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) analysis cannot always explain the long-term behavior of a natural selection-mutation process. Stochastic stability is a more general analysis tool as compared to ESS analysis because it can precisely characterize long-term stochastic behavior. However, one of the reasons why ESS analysis is still widely popular is its computational simplicity. Our objective is to provide a balance between the convenience of ESS analysis and the generality of stochastic stability. The fundamental object in our development is the transitive stability (TS) graph of an evolutionary process. From the TS-graph, we show that we can efficiently compute the smallest set of strategies that always contains the stochastically stable strategies (SSS) for a particular class of evolutionary processes. In particular, we prove that each terminal class of the TS-graph is potentially a stochastically stable group of strategies. In case there is a unique terminal class, then it corresponds exactly to the set of SSS. In case there are multiple terminal classes, then these contain the set of possible SSS, and we show that a unique determination is impossible without higher order analysis.},

abstract = {Global games form a subclass of games with incomplete information where a set of agents decide actions against a regime with an underlying fundamental $\theta$ representing its power. Each agent has access to an independent noisy observation of $\theta$. In order to capture the behavior of agents in a social network of information exchange we assume that agents share their observation in a noisy environment prior to making their decision. We show that global games with noisy sharing of information do not admit an intuitive type of threshold policies which only depends on agents' belief about the underlying $\theta$. This is in contrast to the existing results on the threshold policies for the conventional set-up of global games. Motivated by this result, we investigate the existence of equilibrium strategies in a more general collection of threshold-type policies and show that such equilibrium strategies exist and are unique if the sharing of information happens over a sufficiently noisy environment.},

abstract = {We present a general model for opinion dynamics in a social network together with several possibilities for object selections at times when the agents are communicating. We study the limiting behavior of such a dynamics and show that this dynamics almost surely converges. We consider some special implications of the convergence result for gossip and top-k selective gossip models. In particular, holds in a general setting. Moreover, we propose an extension of the gossip and top-k selective gossip models, and provide some results for their limiting behavior.},

@inproceedings{Marden2015,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 IEEE. In this paper we study the impact of information in a simple multiagent collaborative task - graph coloring. Inspired by the experimental study in [4], we study distributed algorithms for graph coloring where individual nodes are periodically given the opportunity to adjust their color in response to information regarding the color choice of neighboring nodes. When granted such an opportunity, each node chooses an admissible color (if available) that is more prevalent than its current color in its neighborhood. Focusing on the family of ring graphs, our findings demonstrate that there is an inherent trade-off between efficiency and convergence rates for such an algorithm. While increasing the information to the nodes improves the efficiency of the emergent coloring profile, it is also degrades the underlying convergence rates. The degradation in convergence rates provides one possible explanation for the findings in [4], which demonstrate that providing additional information to the nodes, which were controlled by human participants, can actually lead to losses in the efficiency of the emergent coloring profile. These losses could be a byproduct of the human participants not having the desire or time to stay engaged long enough in the revision process.},

abstract = {We consider a distributed consensus problem where a set of agents want to agree on a common value through local computations and communications. We assume that agents communicate over a network with time-varying topology and noisy communication links. We are interested in the case when the link noise is independent in time, and it has zero mean and bounded variance. We present and study an iterative algorithm with a diminishing stepsize. We show that the algorithm converges in expectation and almost surely to a ldquorandomrdquo consensus, and we characterize the statistics of the consensus. In particular, we give the expected value of the consensus and provide an upper bound on its variance.},

abstract = {We consider multi-dimensional Hegselmann-Krause model for opinion dynamics in discrete-time for a set of homogeneous agents. Using dynamic system point of view, we investigate stability properties of the dynamics and show its finite time convergence. The novelty of this work lies in the use of dynamic system approach and the development of Lyapunov-type tools for the analysis of the Hegselmann-Krause model. Furthermore, some new insights and results are provided. The results are valid for any norm that is used to define the neighbor sets. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},
